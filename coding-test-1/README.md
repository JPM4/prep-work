# Coding Challenge I

## What is the coding challenge?

We ask applicants to do a short coding challenge. We will ask you to
solve **four or five coding problems that test basic programming
knowledge**. The challenge is timed: **you will have up to 45 minutes
to complete the challenge**.

## How do I prepare?

**You will want to prepare for the coding challenge so that you do
your best**.

**The coding challenge is meant to be accessible to everyone**. Many
of our applicants have never programmed before.

We provide two sets of resources. The first are a set of readings
about the rudiments of programming that cover what you'll need to know
to do well on the challenges. **We recommend that you at least skim
them even if you already know how to program**:

* **[Introduction To Programming I][intro-to-programming-1]**
* **[Introduction To Programming II][intro-to-programming-2]**
* **[Introduction To Programming III][intro-to-programming-3]**
* **[Introduction To Programming Summary][intro-to-programming-summary]**

[intro-to-programming-1]: ./introduction-to-programming-1.md
[intro-to-programming-2]: ./introduction-to-programming-2.md
[intro-to-programming-3]: ./introduction-to-programming-3.md
[intro-to-programming-summary]: ./introduction-to-programming-summary.md

Students often find it helpful to cover the same material with several
different resources. You may optionally look at:

* [Chris Pine's Learn to Program][chris-pine]
    * Great for beginners; the first nine chapters will be great prep.
* [Ruby Monk][ruby-monk]
    * Complete the following sections in the Ruby Primer section:
    * Introduction to Ruby Objects
    * Introduction to Strings
    * Conditions and Loops
    * Arrays in Ruby

[ruby-monk]: https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer

After you have ready the three parts of Introduction to Programming,
you should begin the practice problems. Doing the practice problems
will build your familiarity with Ruby, and give you a good idea what
the level of difficulty is on the coding challenge. **Complete all the
practice problems before taking the coding challenge**. We want you to
be well prepared.

* **[Practice Problems][practice-problems]**

[practice-problems]: ./practice-problems.md

## What programming language do I write in?

We have designed the challenge to be done in Ruby, which is the
language of Rails. The readings and practice problems we've provided
are in Ruby.

You may also answer the challenge in Python or JavaScript. We will in
no way penalize you for using Python or JavaScript. **You should use
whatever language you are most comfortable with; we want you to do
your best**.

Some languages are not well suited for the coding challenge. If you
know another language and would strongly prefer to answer in that,
please contact us: [admissions@appacademy.io][admissions].

## How soon should I take the challenge?

**Take all the time you need to prepare for the challenge**. We want
you to do your best. We do not give any preference to applicants based
on how soon they take the challenge. Prematurely beginning the
challenge before completing the prepwork will hurt your
application. Taking your time to prepare thoroughly will help you.

The challenge will take up to 45 minutes. **Please have time set aside
so that you can complete the challenege unhurried by other
commitments.**

## Can I use Google for answers during the challenge?

**Please** do not search Google for answers to the problems; it is
very easy for us to tell when solutions have been taken from Google.
**Please do not post the problems to the internet**.

# Prepwork

Below we list some prepwork to complete before taking the first coding
challenge. If you're new to coding, the prepwork is meant to introduce
you to the fundamentals of writing a computer program. After you've
prepared, try out the example problems (and check the solutions!)
before beginning the coding challenge.

* [Basic Ruby Concepts][basic-concepts]
[basic-concepts]: ./basic-concepts.md

[setup]: ./setup.md
